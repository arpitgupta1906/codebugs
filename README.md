<h3>Codefundo++ 2019 Project</h3>
The decentralized web application developed by the team using Azure Blockchain helps citizens of a country to smoothly and quickly register as voters, and cast thier vote in a tamper-proof secure way.

The node which deploys the blockchain is the manager and is responsible for adding the pre-registered candidates to the election portal, starting and ending the election on time. <br>
For the voters, the decentralized web application has two basic functionalities:-

1.<em>Voter Registration:</em> The data entered by the voter is first verified by the smart contract and then added to the voter list of the correct constituency. This functionality will only be active upto a day before election. 
   
2.<em>Voting Portal:</em> Voter belonging to respective constituency will be allowed to cast a vote only after providing a valid pre-registered ID. This functionality will only be active during the time allotted to the election by election officials.

Both these functionalities make use of Azure Blockchain through smart contracts.
